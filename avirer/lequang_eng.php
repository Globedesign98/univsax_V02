              <td width="60%" valign="top"><div align="justify">Curious and  eager to work in a variety of musical languages, Vincent L&ecirc; Quang&rsquo;s activities  have led him to work in the fields of jazz, classical and contemporary music as  a performer, improviser, conductor, composer, and teacher. A gifted  saxophonist, he has developed a specific, immediately recognizable sound and  style.<br>

                <br>

                Following his discovery in 1999 of the &ldquo;soundpainting&rdquo; improvisation technique  created by Walter Thompson, he integrated this language into his music,  constantly refining and re-working the techniques involved. He is an active  member of the Walter Thompson Orchestra based in New York City. <br>
